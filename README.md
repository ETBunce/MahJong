# MahJong
This is a project I worked on for a class at Weber State. It's a MahJong game. Click on matching tiles to remove them and try to remove all tiles from the board to win.
The fireworks class was provided for and not written by me.

In order for images to load, the correctly named images must be placed in bin/images. I have not yet figured out how to add these to the github repository.
